# java-lambda-practice
A group of Java lambda exercices in order to practice the usage of it.

With Java 8, when we are talking about lambda expressions, there are two important packages that
were added:

- java.util.function
- java.util.stream

In order to start talking about lambda, we need to know the concept of *funcional interfaces*:

A functional interface is an interface that contains at most one abstract function or method.

It represents abstract concepts such as functions, actions or predicates.

Most common functional interfaces:

- Predicates - takes one argument, returns a boolean
- Consumer - accepts single argument with no return value
- Function - accepts one argument and produces a result
- Supplier - represents a supplier of results
- UnaryOperator - accepts a single argument with a return value
- BinaryOperator - accepts two arguments and returns one
